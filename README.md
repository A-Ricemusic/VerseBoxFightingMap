## Overview
This project is designed to handle essential backend game logic for a UEFN-created level or experience. By using Verse—Fortnite’s native scripting language—you can effectively manage gameplay elements, ensuring that your experience scales, adapts, and remains stable under various conditions.

## Features
- **Weapon Selection:** Dynamically assign, switch, or restrict player weapon loadouts.
- **Scoring System:** Track and update player or team scores based on kills, objectives, or round results.
- **Round Management:** Start, pause, end, and reset rounds using logic-driven conditions to maintain fairness and balance.
- **Device Integration:** Seamlessly interact with UEFN devices, ensuring events and triggers are handled without friction.
- **Service Integration:** Connect with backend services or external APIs to store stats, run leaderboards, or enable dynamic content updates.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Use `git clone https://github.com/your-username/uefn-verse-backend.git` to clone the project, then navigate to it using `cd uefn-verse-backend`.
   
2. **Open in UEFN:**  
   Add the Verse scripts to your UEFN project and reference them in the appropriate devices or logic nodes.
   
3. **Configure Settings:**
